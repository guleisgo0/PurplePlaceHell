# PurplePlaceHell
A thing I've made for my friends who love Purble Place and hate themselves.

It's currently just a very basic imitation of the "Purble Pairs" game.

Features so far:

  - Purble pairs game:  
    - Basic game works. Matching tiles.
    - Ability to change grid size
    - Timer counting down in "minutes:seconds" format, when timer reaches zero you fail
    - Upon matching a clock tile your time increases by 50 seconds
    - NO WIN FUNCTIONALITY YET
