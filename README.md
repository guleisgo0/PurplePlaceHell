# PurplePlaceHell
A thing I've made for my friends who love Purble Place and hate themselves.

It's currently just a very basic imitation of the "Purble Pairs" game.

Features so far:

  - Purble pairs game:  
    - Basic game works. Matching tiles.
    - Ability to change grid size
    - Timer (Currently counting in seconds), if it get's to zero the game resets
    - NO WIN FUNCTIONALITY YET
    - NONE OF THE SPECIAL TILES HAVE FUNCIONALITY YET
